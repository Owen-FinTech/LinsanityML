# LinsanityML
Machine Learning project for sports forecasting using player stats, team stats and additional data sources.

I’ve chosen this name because I started thinking about what would be the hardest things to predict. I instantly thought of Jeremy Lin’s legendary ‘Linsanity’ streak of mid-February 2012 with the New-York Knicks. What previous stats could have predicted that?
